<H1>Abstract</H1>

<p>
This SRFI proposes a simple extension to Scheme's lexical syntax that
allows individual S-expressions to be made into comments, ignored by
the reader.  This contrasts with the standard Lisp semicolon commnets,
which make the reader ignore the remainder of the line, and the
slightly less common block comments, as <a
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-30/srfi-30.html">SRFI 30</a>
defines: both of these mechanisms comment out slices of text, not
S-expressions.
</p>

<H1>Rationale</H1>

<p>
Line and block comments are useful for embedding textual commentary in
programs, but they are not conducive to commenting out code easily in
an absence of extensive editor support for removing selected text that
composes S-expressions while retaining them in the text itself, or
subsequently removing the comments and re-introducing the S-expressions
themselves.
</p>

<H1>Informal specification</H1>

<p>
A new octothorpe reader syntax character is defined, <tt>#\;</tt>, such
that the reader ignores the S-expression following the <tt>#;</tt> and
proceeds on to the S-expression after that.  For example,
<br>
</p>
<table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(+ 1 #;(* 2 3) 4)</tt></td>
    <td>-reads-&gt; <tt>(+ 1 4)</tt></td>
    <td>-evals-&gt; <tt>5</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(list 'x #;'y 'z)</tt></td>
    <td>-reads-&gt; <tt>(list (quote x) (quote z))</tt></td>
    <td>-evals-&gt; <tt>(x z)</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(* 3 4 #;(+ 1 2))</tt></td>
    <td>-reads-&gt; <tt>(* 3 4)</tt></td>
    <td>-evals-&gt; <tt>12</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>(#;sqrt abs -16)</tt></td>
    <td>-reads-&gt; <tt>(abs -16)</tt></td>
    <td>-evals-&gt; <tt>16</tt></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Some examples of nested S-expression comments may appear confusing at
first, but they are straightforwardly explained.  For instance,
consider the text <tt>(list 'a #; #;'b 'c 'd)</tt>.  This reads as the
list represented by <tt>(list (quote a) (quote d))</tt>.  Note that
both <tt>'b</tt> and <tt>'c</tt> seemed to 'disappear.'  The reason is
simply that when the first <tt>#;</tt> causes the reader to read ahead
in the input stream for the next S-expression, the reader encounters
another <tt>#;</tt>, which causes the <tt>'b</tt> to be consumed, and
which then moves the reader on to <tt>'c</tt> to return as the first
S-expression following the first <tt>#;</tt>.  Since it is the first
S-expression following a <tt>#;</tt>, <tt>'b</tt> is ignored as well,
leaving only <tt>'d</tt>.
</p>

<p>
That is a fairly special case of nested S-expression comments.  Others
are somewhat simpler for intuition to grasp immediately, such as:
<br>
<br>
<tt>(list 'a #;(list 'b #;c 'd) 'e)</tt> -reads-&gt; <tt>(list (quote a) (quote e))</tt> -evals-&gt; <tt>(a e)</tt>
<br>
<br>
There are also some other somewhat peculiar examples, such as in dotted
lists and at the end of lists, which are still simple to grasp:
<br>
<br>
<table border=0 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=0>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>'(a . #;b c)</tt></td>
    <td>-reads-&gt; <tt>(quote (a . c))</tt></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>'(a . b #;c)</tt></td>
    <td>-reads-&gt; <tt>(quote (a . b))</tt></td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>
Note, however, that any text that is invalid without S-expression
comments will be invalid with them as well, and an S-expression comment
prefix, <tt>#;</tt>, must be followed by a complete S-expression (and
after that either a complete S-expression or a special token such as a
closing parenthesis, a dot in dotted lists, or the end of file); for
instance, the following are all errors:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
  <li><tt>(#;a . b)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(a . #;b)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(a #;. b)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(#;x #;y . z)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(#; #;x #;y . z)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(#; #;x . z)</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<H1>Formal specification</H1>

<p>
R5RS's formal syntax is modified as follows:
<ul>
  <li>In section 7.1.1, a <tt>#;</tt> option is added to the
      <tt>&lt;token&gt;</tt> non-terminal.</li>
  <li>In section 7.1.2, a non-terminal <tt>&lt;commented datum&gt;</tt>
      is defined:
<pre>
  &lt;commented datum&gt; ---&gt; "#;" &lt;datum&gt; &lt;datum&gt;
</pre></li>
  <li>Also in section 7.1.2, the <tt>&lt;datum&gt;</tt> non-terminal is
      modified to have a <tt>&lt;commented datum&gt;</tt> option.</li>
  <li>Finally in section 7.1.2, the <tt>&lt;list&gt;</tt> and
      <tt>&lt;vector&gt;</tt> non-terminals are replaced with the
      following rules, along with two auxiliary ones:
<pre>
  &lt;list&gt; ---> "(" &lt;datum&gt;* &lt;optional dot&gt; &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; ")"
  &lt;vector&gt; ---> "#(" &lt;datum&gt;* &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; ")"
  &lt;optional dot&gt; ---> &lt;empty&gt; | &lt;datum&gt; &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; "." &lt;datum&gt;
  &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; ---> &lt;empty&gt; | "#;" &lt;datum&gt; &lt;delimiter prefix&gt;
</pre></li>
</ul>
The first datum in a <tt>&lt;commented datum&gt;</tt> is ignored
semantically, as is any datum immediately following a <tt>#;</tt> token
in a delimiter prefix.
<br><br>
All of the new or modified rules are presented here:
<pre>
  7.1.1:

    &lt;token&gt; ---> &lt;identifier&gt; | &lt;boolean&gt; | &lt;number&gt;
        | &lt;character&gt; | &lt;string&gt;
        | "(" | ")" | "#(" | "'" | "`" | "," | ",@" | "." | "#;"

  7.1.2:

    &lt;datum&gt; ---> &lt;simple datum&gt; | &lt;compound datum&gt;
        | &lt;commented datum&gt;
    &lt;commented datum&gt; ---> "#;" &lt;datum&gt; &lt;datum&gt;
    &lt;list&gt; ---> "(" &lt;datum&gt;* &lt;optional dot&gt; &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; ")"
    &lt;vector&gt; ---> "#(" &lt;datum&gt;* &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; ")"
    &lt;optional dot&gt; ---> &lt;empty&gt; | &lt;datum&gt; &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; "." &lt;datum&gt;
    &lt;delimiter prefix&gt; ---> &lt;empty&gt; | "#;" &lt;datum&gt; &lt;delimiter prefix&gt;
</pre>
